# 💻 Java OOPS Concepts

Welcome to the **Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) Concepts** repository!  
This project contains clear and practical examples demonstrating the core concepts of OOP using Java — ideal for beginners, interview prep, and brushing up fundamentals.

## 📁 Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders, each showcasing a core OOP concept in Java:

| 📂 Folder Name           | 🧠 Concept           | 📄 Description |
|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| `class_Objects/`     | Class & Objects       | Basic unit of OOP — contains blueprint and object creation examples. |
| `Inheritance/`           | Inheritance           | Demonstrates how classes can inherit properties and methods. |
| `Polymorphism/`          | Polymorphism          | Shows method overloading and overriding in action. |
| `Abstraction/`           | Abstraction           | Abstract classes and interfaces that hide internal details. |
| `Encapsulation/`         | Encapsulation         | Hides internal state and requires all interaction through methods. |

## 🔍 OOP Concepts in Java

### 🔸 1. Class and Objects
> Classes are blueprints; objects are instances of classes.  
Includes real-world examples to show object creation, initialization, and method invocation.

### 🔸 2. Inheritance
> Enables code reusability by allowing a child class to inherit properties and behaviors from a parent class.

### 🔸 3. Polymorphism
> The ability of one entity to take many forms.  
Covers both:
- **Compile-time Polymorphism** (Method Overloading)
- **Run-time Polymorphism** (Method Overriding)

### 🔸 4. Abstraction
> Hiding implementation details and showing only functionality using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.

### 🔸 5. Encapsulation
> Wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class), and restricting direct access using access modifiers.
